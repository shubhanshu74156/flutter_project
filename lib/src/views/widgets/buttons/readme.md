Material Design 3 offers a versatile range of buttons suitable for a member management system in Flutter. Here are some key types to consider:

**Common Buttons:**

* **Elevated Button:** Provides visual prominence with a raised surface, ideal for primary actions like adding new members or saving changes.
* **Filled Button:** Offers strong emphasis with a solid background, good for secondary actions like editing member details or searching.
* **Filled Tonal Button:** A subtle variation of the Filled Button with a background color matching the app theme, useful for less impactful actions like viewing member profiles.
* **Outlined Button:** Offers a clear outline without a filled background, suitable for less important actions like filtering members or cancelling operations.
* **Text Button:** A minimal button with just text, best for low-impact actions like navigation or toggling options.

**Other Relevant Button Types:**

* **Icon Button:** Provides a compact button with an icon, ideal for quick actions like deleting members or refreshing data.
* **Segmented Button:** Groups related options into a single component, perfect for choosing member roles or membership types.
* **Floating Action Button (FAB):** A prominent circular button at the bottom of the screen, great for initiating new actions like creating new members or launching communication tools.
* **Extended FAB:** An expanded version of the FAB with additional text or icon, useful for combining actions like adding a member with specific details.

**Choosing the right button:**

* **Match the button type to the action's importance and impact.** High-impact actions need more prominent buttons like Elevated or Filled, while low-impact actions can use Text or Outlined buttons.
* **Consider the context and user flow.** Use consistent button placements and styles for similar actions across the app.
* **Maintain visual hierarchy.** Prioritize high-impact buttons with stronger visual presence to avoid user confusion.

Remember, Material Design 3 also allows for extensive customization. You can adjust shapes, borders, colors, and padding to further refine your button styles and enhance your member management system's usability and visual appeal.

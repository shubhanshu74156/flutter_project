//  **The contents of `i18n.dart` file vary depending on the internationalization approach you're using in your Flutter app.**

// **Here are common scenarios:**

// **1. Using the `intl` package with generated localization files:**

// - In this case, `i18n.dart` is typically a **generated file** that you shouldn't modify directly. It contains:
//     - Imports for necessary libraries (`dart:async`, `flutter/foundation.dart`, `flutter/material.dart`).
//     - **A class definition** (e.g., `S`) that implements `WidgetsLocalizations` and acts as a delegate for localization data.
//     - **Static methods** for accessing localized strings (e.g., `S.of(context).hello`).

// **2. Using other localization packages like `i18n_extension`:**

// - The contents of `i18n.dart` might differ, but often include:
//     - Definitions for **translation keys** (constants representing translatable strings).
//     - Logic for accessing **translations from a translation source** (e.g., a JSON file or API).
//     - Helper methods for **formatting and pluralizing** localized strings.

// **3. Manual localization:**

// - If you're not using a dedicated package, you might create an `i18n.dart` file to:
//     - Store **translation maps** (key-value pairs for different languages).
//     - Define **functions for retrieving translations** based on the current locale.

// **Key points:**

// - The specific content of `i18n.dart` depends on your localization setup.
// - It's often a generated file for the `intl` package, so avoid manual changes.
// - Other packages might have different file structures and contents.
// - Ensure you understand the approach used in your project before modifying this file.
